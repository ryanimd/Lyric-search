# Lyric-search

For this project, I created a website that allows users to search for lyrics to songs. For the lyrics, I used an api from 'Lyrics.ovh', and for the info about the songs, I used another api from 'Last.fm'.

# Unsolved Problems

1) I could not figure out how to get suggestions to songs or artist to pop up as the user was typing.

2) For songs that had multiple artist, I was unsure of how to get all of their names to display without the user having to type them all in the search bar.
